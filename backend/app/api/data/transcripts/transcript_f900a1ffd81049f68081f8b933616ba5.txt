The FIA listened and made this adjustment to reflect concerns about freedom of expression during races. It's like they're trying to keep the sport fair and respectful, while also allowing drivers to express their frustrations."
</Person1><Person2> "That makes sense. And Formula 1 is celebrating its 75th anniversary with an interactive digital experience. Tell us more about that!"
</Person2><Person1> "Fans can now design, create, and customize their own F1 circuits online. It's a fantastic way to engage with the sport and even win race tickets. It's like giving fans a chance to be part of the action, not just spectators."
